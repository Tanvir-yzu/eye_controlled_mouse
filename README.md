# Eye-Controlled Mouse

This project allows you to control your mouse cursor and perform clicks using your eye movements and blinks, leveraging computer vision and media processing technologies. It uses OpenCV for image processing, MediaPipe for facial landmark detection, and PyAutoGUI for controlling the mouse cursor.

## Prerequisites

Before you can run this project, you'll need to have the following installed:
- Python 3.6 or higher
- OpenCV
- MediaPipe
- PyAutoGUI

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-repository/eye-controlled-mouse.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```sh
   cd eye-controlled-mouse
   ```
3. **Install the required Python packages:**
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To start controlling your mouse with your eyes, simply run the main script:

```sh
python main.py
```

Position yourself in front of your webcam and ensure your face is clearly visible. You can move the mouse cursor by looking around and perform a click by blinking your left eye.

## How It Works

- The program captures video from your webcam.
- It then processes the video frames to detect your face and specifically the landmarks around your eyes using MediaPipe.
- By mapping these landmarks to screen coordinates, it moves the mouse cursor accordingly.
- A blink detection algorithm is used to trigger mouse clicks.
